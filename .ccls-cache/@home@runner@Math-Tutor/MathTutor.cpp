Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student.
The program should then pause while the student works on the problem. When the student is ready to check the answer, he or she can press a key and the program will display the correct solution.
Once you have coded this and placed in your main branch in GitHub, create a second branch that revises your code so that before the answer is displayed allow the user to enter an answer . Then display the correct answer and tell the student either "You are correct" or "Your answer is not correct."
